3. **QA** — Creates and runs test plans and test cases (manual and automated); finds and documents bugs; checks that fixes and releases meet quality standards; works with developers to improve quality.

4. **SRE** — Keeps systems reliable and performant; sets up monitoring and alerting; handles incidents and post-mortems; automates operations and capacity planning.

5. **Security engineer** — Implements and reviews security controls; does vulnerability assessments and code audits; responds to security incidents; helps secure integrations (e.g. payment flows).

- CI/CD and scripting (Bash, Python, etc.)
- Monitoring, logging, and observability

## Personal reflection

I chose this role because deployment is a very responsible task and it must not be taken by AI. I guess that my skillset is enough to make some simple deployments, but I am lacking a lot of enterprise skills needed for job. During the semester I will learn about containers orchestration, logs/secrets/artifacts management and monitoring of the infrastructure.
